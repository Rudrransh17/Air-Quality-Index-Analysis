# Air Quality Index Analysis

This project is aimed at analyzing the Air Quality Index (AQI) of major Indian cities by using data of pollutant concentration for the years 2017-2020. The project includes cleaning the data, visualizing the data, and using different models to predict the AQI and concentration of different pollutants.

## Data

The project uses a dataset of major Indian cities' AQI and pollutant concentration. The data was collected for the years 2017-2020. The data was cleaned and reorganized to separate the data of each pollutant and AQI for different cities into separate files.

## Models

The project uses different models to predict the AQI and concentration of pollutants. The models used are:

- CatBoost
- LSTM
- ELM
- Decision Tree
- Elastic Net
- Random Forest
- SVM

Each model was trained on the preprocessed data, and its validation score was recorded for comparison.

## Usage

To run the project, you need to have Python 3 installed, along with the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- catboost

The notebook contains the code for cleaning and visualizing the data, and training the different models to predict the AQI and concentration of pollutants. The notebook also includes the comparison of validation scores of different models.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to analyze and predict the AQI and concentration of pollutants of major Indian cities using different machine learning models. The project includes data cleaning, visualization, and comparison of different models. The project can be easily extended to include more models and more cities.
